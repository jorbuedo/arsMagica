Although demons deal in Vim, they are made of the essence of deception itself. If a demon does not wish to be detected, it cannot be (at least to the common knowledge of the Order), and for this reason there are no demon-locating magics. Magic items cannot be investigated with simple magic spells. Investigation requires that you spend at least one season in the laboratory to discover what magic an enchanted item contains (see the Laboratory chapter). A spell will suffice to tell you that an item is magical, however, and may give you some idea of its powers. Spells will never tell you how to use an item. Basic range is Near, basic duration is Concentration, and basic target is Individual. A first magnitude Intellego Vim spell will detect magical effects of tenth magnitude or higher. For every magnitude by which the detecting spell is increased, decrease the minimum spell to be detected by two magnitudes. Thus, a sixth magnitude spell will detect 'zero magnitude' effects: the traces of powerful magic, or the recent presence of weak magic. Further increases in level will give increased sensitivity to residues. This level of spell also gives a fairly good idea of the strength of the magic (within a magnitude). The addition of one magnitude will say whether the effect is Hermetic, and a magus familiar with other types of magic will be able to identify them as well. The addition of two magnitudes will give information about Technique and Form, or nearest equivalent for other types of magic. Further increases in level will yield further information, depending on the design of the specific spell. Different spells may be invented to detect Faerie, Divine, or Infernal effects. Each spell only affects one realm, and storyguides may wish to disallow spells to detect the Divine or Infernal. As a general rule, residues of magic decline as follows. As soon as the magic finishes, the magnitude halves. It then drops by one for every duration of the spell that passes. Storyguides should employ this as a guideline, not a rigid formula, and may, if they wish, allow high level detection spells to pick up residues with 'negative magnitude'. Magical items have an effective residue magnitude equal to the number of pawns of vis used to open the enchantment (or half the total pawns used for lesser enchanted devices)." +
            "Magnitudes of non Hermetic items must be set by the storyguide. A spell to detect items will not also detect effects or creatures, and vice-versa. Variants will detect items enchanted by different Realms, as above. Magical creatures can also be detected. Treat their Might as the level of the effect: for Hermetic magi, use their highest Art. Divide Might or highest Art by five (rounding up) to get the effective residue magnitude. Again, this requires a different spell, and variants may detect Faerie and possibly Divine creatures. Demons may not be detected. Storyguides may, at their option, allow spells that detect other Infernal creatures, such as diabolists and undead. Raw vis will show up as magical, simply as raw vis, under any magical detection. The level of the detecting spell is irrelevant, as is the realm of power that it was designed to detect. However, only specially designed spells will yield any information other than that it is raw vis.",

Magi can cast spells while in animal form, but they suffer the normal -15 penalty for casting without hands or voice. The transformed person gains any abilities the animal form has though it may take a day or so of experience to get used to using them. To change accouterments along with the body involves requisites. For example, you need a casting requisite of Animal for leather worn, Aquam for any liquids carried, and Terram for metal objects worn (including studs in armor). Accouterments are transformed only if they are actually being worn, not if they are just being carried in the hand. Simply put, equipment will not be transformed for one of two reasons: either because you choose not to use the casting requisites or because the storyguide rules that the equipment is not sufficiently part of the target's worn equipment. This untransformed equipment falls to the ground. When you are under the influence of one of your own shapechanging spells, you may change yourself back by concentrating, but doing so ends the spell.

The basic range is Reach, the basic duration is Special (these spells are not well described by the standard durations), and the basic target is Individual. Most Muto Vim spells last as long as the spell that they have altered. These meta-magical spells have certain special restrictions, which apply to all Muto Vim spells invented according to Hermetic theory. First of all, they cannot be cast on spontaneous spells. Such magic is being manipulated at whim-any attempt to alter it further would make the caster lose control. Secondly, when you cast a MuVi spell, you get double the normal botch dice. Magi who have mastered the spell roll the normal number. Even if the spell is mastered, you must roll a stress die. The same applies to the spell that you are casting on, even if it is being cast by another magus, and even if it is mastered. If either spell botches, both do. Thirdly, you must make an Intelligence + Concentration roll of 9+ if you are casting both spells (that is, the MuVi spell and the spell it is affecting). If this fails, the spells do not go off. If it botches, they botch. You don't have to double botch dice on it, though. If you wish to cast one of these spells on a spell being cast by another magus, you must either be co-operating, or you must fast cast the MuVi spell spontaneously. There is no other way to get the timing right. In addition, your Penetration total for the Muto Vim spell must beat the other magus's Penetration total for the spell to be changed, unless you are co-operating. These spells can only be used on Hermetic magic, as they depend on a good understanding of the processes involved. You may only put a Muto Vim effect into a magical item if it is to work with another effect in that item. All Muto Vim spells require some tailoring to the specific use, hence the additional botch dice, and a magical item effect cannot be so tailored. Note that a spell invented according to one of the guidelines below will change another spell in a specific way: it is not possible to invent a single spell which changes another spell however the caster wants.

This may change the Technique, Form, or both of the target spell, and needs no requisites for those Arts. The Vim spell affects the structure of the spell, not the things that the spell targets.
